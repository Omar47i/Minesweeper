Game description from Wikipedia:
-------------------------------
The player is initially presented with a grid of undifferentiated
squares. Some randomly selected squares, unknown to the player,
are designated to contain mines. Typically, the size of the grid and
the number of mines are set in advance by the user, either by
entering the numbers or selecting from defined skill levels,
depending on the implementation. The number of mines, is
equivalent to 1/3 the number of squares, or less.
The game is played by revealing squares of the grid by clicking or
otherwise indicating each square. If a square containing a mine is
revealed, the player loses the game. If no mine is revealed, a digit
is instead displayed in the square, indicating how many adjacent
squares contain mines; if no mines are adjacent, the square
becomes blank, and all adjacent squares will be recursively
revealed. The player uses this information to deduce the contents
of other squares, and may either safely reveal each square or mark
the square as containing a mine.
